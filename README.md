# Compiling

Uses Webpack "Laravel mix" for compiling LESS into minified css & js into minified

**Use the files in source to generate the compiled files.**
source/sass/styles.scss
source/js/scripts.js

```bash

# Local development
npm run watch

# This will run browserSync and allow realtime compiling which can be accessed via http://localhost:4040

# Or for a quick compile on development to run once
npm run development

# Production development
npm run production
```
*npm run procuction* needs to be run before deployment :shipit: .
Ideally it will be done via the server one day...
